2. Calculates DEMA indicators for both high and low prices
3. Opens long positions when:
   - Price closes below the low DEMA
   - The cents of the low price are 0.00
4. Opens short positions when:
   - Price closes above the high DEMA
   - The cents of the high price are 0.00
5. Closes positions when price crosses the opposite DEMA
6. Uses 100x leverage for all trades
7. Sends notifications via Telegram for all trade actions
